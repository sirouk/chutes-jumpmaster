# Chutes Jumpmaster

Jumpmaster is a control-plane workspace for operating in the Chutes ecosystem.

Primary jobs:

- **Track upstream changes across core Chutes repos** - Keep sub-repos current and inspect diffs quickly
- **Build, run, and deploy chutes with `utils.sh`** - Interactive hub for the full lifecycle: build, discover, deploy, logs, warmup
- **Wrap upstream Docker images into chutes** - Auto-discover routes and register passthrough cords

Everything here is vendor-neutral—you can reuse the exact workflow for any service that needs to run on Chutes.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Setup environment (creates .venv, installs deps, registers with Chutes)
./setup.sh

# 2. Use the interactive hub for everything else
./utils.sh
```

---

## Core Sub-Repositories

This repository is a workspace for several core Chutes repos, managed locally via `update_all_repos.sh`.

| Repository | Purpose | URL |
|-----------|---------|-----|
| `chutes/` | Python SDK for building images and chutes | [github.com/chutesai/chutes](https://github.com/chutesai/chutes) |
| `chutes-api/` | API server and validation logic | [github.com/chutesai/chutes-api](https://github.com/chutesai/chutes-api) |
| `chutes-miner/` | GPU miner code for running chutes | [github.com/chutesai/chutes-miner](https://github.com/chutesai/chutes-miner) |
| `chutes-e2ee-transport/` | End-to-end encrypted communication | [github.com/chutesai/chutes-e2ee-transport](https://github.com/chutesai/chutes-e2ee-transport) |
| `sek8s/` | Kubernetes integration and infrastructure | [github.com/chutesai/sek8s](https://github.com/chutesai/sek8s) |

### Keeping Repos in Sync

Run `update_all_repos.sh` to fetch and pull latest changes from all sub-repositories:

```bash
./update_all_repos.sh
```

On first run, the script will display the default repo list and prompt you to add any extra repos. Your choices are saved to `.sub-repos` (untracked) and used on all subsequent runs.

---

## Daily Ops Loop

Use this loop to stay current and operational:

1. Sync all tracked upstream repos:
   ```bash
   ./update_all_repos.sh
   ```
2. Inspect what changed in the sub-repos (`chutes/`, `chutes-api/`, `chutes-miner/`, etc.) using your IDE or git diff tools.
3. Use `./utils.sh` to build, deploy, check status, stream logs, and warm chutes as needed.

---

## Architecture & Methodology

**Strategy:** Keep the vendor image intact and inject the Chutes runtime so the exact same binaries continue to run. Only use the metadata-rebuild path (replaying steps onto the `parachutes/python` base) when you explicitly want a fresh foundation—for example, to audit each layer or to publish a clean-room replica. Even if the upstream container uses Conda or custom CUDA stacks, we still prefer to wrap *that* image so it behaves identically once deployed.

### Tooling

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Auto-Discovery (`utils.sh --discover` / `tools/discover_routes.py`)** | Boots the upstream image locally, probes common OpenAPI endpoints, and writes `deploy_*.routes.json` so passthrough cords can be generated automatically. |
| **Wrapper SDK (`tools/chute_wrappers.py`)** | Injects system Python, the `chutes` user, OpenCL libs, and helper scripts into any base image. Handles route registration, startup waits, and health checks. |
| **Image Generator (`tools/create_chute_from_image.py`)** | Replays an existing Docker image's metadata on top of the Chutes base (`deploy_*_auto.py`), giving you a reproducible python-first version that still launches the original entrypoint. |
| **Vanilla examples (`vanilla_examples/`)** | Pure-Python chutes that instantiate `Chute`/`ChuteImage` directly—useful when you want the traditional `torch.cuda` debugging loop without the wrapper layer. |

---

## Upstream Change Inspection

The Chutes Jumpmaster setup is designed for efficient local development with modern IDEs equipped with LLM support (VS Code, Cursor, etc.):

### Discovering Changes in Core Repos

When changes come down the pipeline from upstream chutes repos, use these tools to understand what's new:

1. **`update_all_repos.sh`** - Pull latest changes from all sub-repositories
2. **Explore source code** - IDE-integrated navigation through Python/TypeScript/Go code

### Running OpenAPI Discovery

The discovery tool spins up a container, probes for OpenAPI specs, and generates route definitions:

```bash
# Via the interactive hub (prompts for delays/gpus)
./utils.sh --discover deploy_my_service

# Or directly
python tools/discover_routes.py --chute-file deploy_my_service.py \
    --startup-delay 300 --probe-timeout 60 --docker-gpus all
```

This generates a `deploy_my_service.routes.json` file containing all discovered endpoints, which can then be used when building the chute.

### Creating Chutes from Existing Images

The `create_chute_from_image.py` tool helps you jumpstart chute development:

```bash
# Generate a chute definition from any Docker image
python tools/create_chute_from_image.py elbios/xtts-whisper:latest \
    --name xtts-whisper --gpus all --interactive
```

This produces a `deploy_xtts_whisper_auto.py` file that you can further customize.

---

## Typical Paths

1. **Auto-Discovery + Wrapper (original image with Chutes injected).** Run discovery to capture the service's OpenAPI, then call `build_wrapper_image()` so the upstream container keeps its own stack while inheriting the Chutes runtime. This is the fastest way to deploy vendor images unchanged.
2. **Image Generator (Chutes base image with the original entrypoint).** Use `tools/create_chute_from_image.py` to rebuild the Dockerfile onto `parachutes/python`, but keep the upstream entrypoint so its services still launch exactly as before—ideal for auditing layers or when you need a reproducible base.
3. **Vanilla Rebuild (Chutes base + rewritten services).** Start from the Chutes base image and reimplement services directly in Python (see `vanilla_examples/`). This gives you explicit `torch` usage, cords, and lifecycle hooks for the tightest debugging loop.

---

## Platform Context

Chutes behaves like a less restrictive, GPU-aware AWS Lambda. Containers can stay warm, keep local caches, and expose arbitrary HTTP routes. The router expects JSON payloads for quota tracking—e.g., when adapting a legacy XTTS/Whisper workflow you'd wrap audio bytes in JSON (base64) or add a proxy to do it automatically.

- **Future Direction:** Images can return JSON-wrapped audio responses as well, opening the door to multi-part emulation in the SDK later.

---

## Workflow

### 1. Setup (`./setup.sh`)

Interactive wizard that:
- Installs `uv` and creates `.venv` (Python 3.11)
- Installs the `chutes` CLI and supporting deps
- Helps you register a new Chutes account *or* link an existing website account to a Bittensor wallet via fingerprint-authenticated `/users/change_bt_auth`, then write `~/.chutes/config.ini`

### 2. Build & Deploy (`./utils.sh`)

Interactive hub with 13 menu options, or use flags directly:

| Category | Option | Capability |
|----------|--------|------------|
| Account | **1** | Show username + payment address from config |
| Account | **2** | Link existing Chutes account to local Bittensor wallet via fingerprint-authenticated `/users/change_bt_auth` and write `~/.chutes/config.ini` |
| Build/Discovery | **3** | Build from local `deploy_*.py` (wraps `CHUTE_BASE_IMAGE`) |
| Build/Discovery | **4** | Create a chute definition from an existing Docker image |
| Local Run | **5** | Run wrapped service in Docker (GPU sanity check) |
| Local Run | **6** | Run chute in host dev mode |
| Cloud Ops | **7** | Deploy chute (upload + schedule on Chutes.ai) |
| Cloud Ops | **8** | Chute status (health + instances) |
| Cloud Ops | **9** | Warmup + stream logs via SDK watcher (`chutes warmup <chute> --stream-logs`) |
| Cloud Ops | **10** | Warmup once (manual spin-up) |
| Cloud Ops | **11** | Keep warm loop (repeated warmup) |
| Cleanup | **12** | List & delete chutes (interactive safety checks) |
| Cleanup | **13** | List & delete images |

**CLI flag examples**
```bash
./utils.sh --discover deploy_xtts_whisper
./utils.sh --build deploy_xtts_whisper --local
./utils.sh --deploy deploy_xtts_whisper --accept-fee
./utils.sh --logs xtts-whisper
```

### 3. Route Discovery

```bash
./utils.sh --discover deploy_myservice
```
1. Starts the base image in Docker with GPU access
2. Waits for startup
3. Probes `/openapi.json`, `/docs.json`, `/docs/openapi.json`, `/swagger.json`
4. Writes `deploy_myservice.routes.json`

If no manifest exists when you choose "Build chute," the script defaults the discovery prompt to **Yes** to avoid deploying an image with no cords.

---

## Deploy Script Structure

```python
from tools.chute_wrappers import build_wrapper_image, load_route_manifest, register_passthrough_routes

CHUTE_NAME = "xtts-whisper"
CHUTE_TAG = "tts-stt-v0.1.16"
CHUTE_BASE_IMAGE = "elbios/xtts-whisper:latest"
SERVICE_PORTS = [8020, 8080]
CHUTE_STATIC_ROUTES = [{"port": 8080, "method": "POST", "path": "/inference"}]

image = build_wrapper_image(USERNAME, CHUTE_NAME, CHUTE_TAG, CHUTE_BASE_IMAGE, env=CHUTE_ENV)

chute = Chute(
    username=USERNAME,
    name=CHUTE_NAME,
    image=image,
    node_selector=NodeSelector(gpu_count=1, min_vram_gb_per_gpu=16),
)

register_passthrough_routes(
    chute,
    load_route_manifest(static_routes=CHUTE_STATIC_ROUTES),
    SERVICE_PORTS[0],
)
```

## Vanilla Examples (traditional chutes)

Most guidance here focuses on wrapping upstream Docker images, but some services are still easier to express as straight Python modules. Those canonical "vanilla" samples live in `vanilla_examples/`:

- `vanilla_examples/deploy_example_imggen.py` – Fully managed FastAPI chute that imports `ChuteImage`, keeps models on `torch.cuda`, and exposes inference cords directly.
- `vanilla_examples/deploy_example_sglang.py` – Minimal `build_sglang_chute` example that matches the way first-party SGLang chutes are deployed.

**Why bother with the vanilla path**
- It is the original Chutes development flow: `import chutes`, allocate GPUs with `NodeSelector`, and call `torch.cuda.*` yourself, so stepping through failures is just Python debugging.
- You can run these modules locally (`python vanilla_examples/deploy_example_imggen.py`) without rebuilding a wrapper image, which shortens the iteration loop.
- Perfect when you are building the container from scratch and want explicit control over installs, caching, and warmup scripts.

## Troubleshooting Cheat Sheet

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Multipart calls return 400 | Convert to JSON + base64 payload, or add a proxy that does it |
| No routes discovered | Add `CHUTE_STATIC_ROUTES` or rerun discovery with longer delays |
| Build segfaults | Ensure `build_wrapper_image` injects system Python; Conda-only bases fail `chutes-inspecto` |
| Remote build rejected | Requires ≥ $50 balance; use `--local` during development |
| Chute never warms | Use menu option 11 (keep warm loop) and watch instance logs |
